Because of the GitHub file size restrictions, the training dataset was moved to the EEG/ERP Portal
and is available for download under: http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz/experiments-detail?2&DEFAULT_PARAM_ID=237 .

Extract the package into this folder (../training_dataset). The set2.vhdr file should be located at the root 
of this directory. Alternatively, it is possible to change paths in ../src/run.m file.

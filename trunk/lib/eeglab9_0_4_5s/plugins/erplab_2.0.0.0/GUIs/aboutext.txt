Because this is not commercial software, bugs are inevitable#
In some cases,  errors will occur leading to a message that#
instructs you to report the error to the EEGLAB developers.#
If this happens, please report the error to erplab@erpinfo.org#
and not to the EEGLAB developers. ERPLAB has primarily been#
tested using EEG collected with a Biosemi ActiveTwo System,#
along with a smaller amount of testing using EEG collected#
with Neuroscan and EGI systems. Consequently, you should be#
particularly careful when using this version of ERPLAB with#
data collected with systems other than the Biosemi ActiveTwo.#

    % Advanced paradigm for oscillatory processes via the Spectrally weighted CSP algorithm.
    %
    % The Spec-CSP paradigm [1] is a more advanced variant of CSP, developed for the Berlin
    % Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI); the primary focus was motor imagery BCI, but the algorithm was
    % designed from the outset to be applicable for a wider range of applications. The implementation
    % closely follows the TR [2].
    %
    % The paradigm is applicable to the majority of oscillatory processes, and is the most advanced
    % spatio-spectrally adaptive method that is currently provided in the toolbox. Whenever the exact
    % frequency and location of some (conjectured) oscillatory process is not known exactly, Spec-CSP
    % can be used, and typically gives better results than CSP with an appropriately unrestricted (e.g.,
    % broad-band) spectral filter. Several other methods exist to adapt the spectrum to a process of
    % interest, among others Common Spatio-Spectral Patterns [3], Common Sparse Spectral Spatial Pattern
    % [4], r^2-based heuristics [5], automated parameter search, and manual selection based on visual
    % inspection. Several of these methods have been shown to give approx. comparable results [2]. An
    % alternative and competitive method, especially when there complex interactions between frequency
    % bands and time periods are to be modeled is the Dual-Augmented Lagrange paradigm
    % (para_dal/para_dal_hf).
    %
    % The method iteratively optimizes spatial and spectral filters in alternation and extracts
    % log-variance features from the resulting (filtered) signal. These features are subsequently
    % processed by a (typically simple) machine learning component, by default LDA. Learning is
    % therefore significantly slower than CSP. An option is to impose custom prior knowledge on the
    % relevant data spectrum, for example by placing a focus on the alpha rhythm, without ruling out
    % other frequencies. Note that there are parameters which constrain the spectrum: one is the
    % frequency prior and the other is the spectral filter that is applied before running the alorithm;
    % both need to be adapted when the considered spectrum shall be extended (e.g. to high-gamma
    % oscillations). Other parameters which are frequently adapted are the time window of interest and
    % the learner component (e.g., logistic regression is a good alternative choice).
    %
    % Some application areas include detection of major brain rhythm modulations (e.g. theta, alpha,
    % beta, gamma), for example related to relaxation/stress, aspects of workload, emotion,
    % sensori-motor imagery, and in general cortical idle oscillations in various modalities.
    %
    % Example: Consider the goal of predicting the emotion felt by a person at a given time. A possible
    % calibration data set for this task would contain a sequence of blocks in each of which the subject
    % is one out of several possible emotions, indicated by events 'e1','e2','e3','e4' covering these
    % blocks at regular rate. The data might for example be induced via guided imagery [6].
    %
    %   calib = io_loadset('data sets/bruce/emotions.eeg')
    %   myapproach = {'SpecCSP' 'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',[-2.5 2.5]}};
    %   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',calib,'Approach',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'e1','e2','e3','e4'});

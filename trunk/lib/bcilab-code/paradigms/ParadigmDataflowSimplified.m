classdef ParadigmDataflowSimplified < ParadigmBaseSimplified
    % Base class for simple dataflow-oriented BCI paradigms.
    %
    % This is the base class that almost all traditional (non-multi-subject and single-stream) BCI
    % paradigms should be derived from.
    %
    % Most such BCI paradigms do the following during online processing: The raw input signal is
    % first sent through a series of filter steps (i.e., signal processing), each here implemented
    % as a flt_***.m plugin function (e.g. spatial and spectral filters). To compute an estimate of
    % (or inference about) the cognitive state of the user at a particular time point in the signal,
    % a "prediction function" is invoked on a segment of that signal. It then typically first
    % extracts a set of features from the signal (yielding a feature vector or matrix) and then
    % passes on the feature vector to a machine learning plugin's prediction function (an
    % ml_predict***.m function) to obtain the desired output. The feature extraction and predictive
    % mapping can also be implemented as a custom combined step without going through a machine
    % learning plugin.
    %
    % The prediction function performs its processing with the help of a (separately computed)
    % "predictive model", which is a MATLAB struct that contains any parameters necessary for online
    % processing. A predictive model is computed in a dedicated calibration (a.k.a. 'training') step
    % based on a calibration recording. Such a recording is typically a 10-60 minute EEGLAB data set
    % which is annotated with target markers that indicate the desired output of the BCI at various
    % time points. During calibration, both the signal processing stages, the feature extraction
    % function, as well as the machine learning part may be adapted to optimally predict the desired
    % outputs for some given input signal data. In a dataflow model, calibration consists of first
    % applying a (custom-defined) sequence of pre-processing (i.e. filter) steps to the raw signal,
    % then optionally adapting any features based on the contents of the processed signal or
    % additional user parameters, and finally applying a machine learning plugin function (an
    % ml_train***.m function) to learn a statistical map from the (labeled) feature vectors (as
    % previously extracted from the data) onto the desired outputs (= labels). The feature
    % adaptation / extraction and machine learning can also be implemented in a signal combined step,
    % without the need to go through a separate plugin function.
    %
    % Derive from this class if your processing consists of a chain of filter steps followed by a
    % (possibly adaptive) feature extraction, followed by a machine learning step, and if in your
    % paradigm, calibration is done based on a single data set (i.e. neither dataset collections nor
    % stream bundles are handled meaningfully by it).
    %
    % * you supply a feature_adapt() function which takes a signal and arbitrary optional arguments
    %   and packages any information needed by the feature-extraction stage into a "feature model"
    %   struct (e.g. user parameters or signal-dependent parameters).
    % * you supply a feature_extract() function which takes a signal and a previously computed feature
    %   model and extracts features for every trial in the signal.
    % * typically, you specify the default signal processing stages to apply before feature extraction
    %   and the default machine learning step to apply after feature extraction (both of which can be
    %   overridden by users of the paradigm), by overriding preprocessing_defaults() and/or
    %   machine_learning_defaults()
    %
    % * optionally, you specify a visualize_model function for the resulting model and a default
    %   specification for a configuration dialog (dialog_layout_defaults, see other paradigms for examples).
    %
    % * if your learning and prediction process (after signal processing) is non-traditional (e.g. you
    %   perform a computation that blends traditional feature extraction and machine learning, or
    %   the notion of data points in your machine learning differs from the marker-locked trials in the
    %   calibration data), you may implement your own calibrate_prediction_function() and
    %   optionally apply_prediction_function() methods. In this case you may ignore the feature_adapt()
    %   and feature_extract() functions.

            % Out:
            %   Defaults : cell array of name-value pairs (or a struct) controlling the default settings
            %              for flt_pipeline (see this function for detailed information on the syntax).
            %
            % Notes:
            %   Here you can define which of the available signal processing plugins you want to
            %   apply to the raw input signal (e.g. FIR band-pass, epoch extraction, resampling),
            %   and what parameters should be used to call them. This is done by returning a cell
            %   array of the form {filtername, parameters, filtername, parameters, ...} where the
            %   filtername is either the name of a flt_*** function or its human-readable (and
            %   CamelCase) name; any filter declares such a name in a declare_properties(...) line
            %   at the beginning of the function. The CamelCase name is recommended here for
            %   consistency with the GUI display of these filters. The parameters of the filter are
            %   most generally a cell array of the function's inputs, or, if only one input is
            %   passed, may also be just the value itself (e.g. some numeric array). This is also
            %   the same way in which the filter stages to apply can be passed to flt_pipeline.m
            %   (which is the "dispatch function used internally by ParadigmDataflowSimplified,
            %   and which contains some additional documentation about the syntax allowed here).
            %
            %   The order in which filters are listed here is ignored, and instead usually
            %   auto-determined based on some common ordering rules (each filter declares some
            %   required and/or preferred ordering relationships); it may however be overridden partially
            %   or completely by appending a 'FilterOrdering',{'filtername','filtername','filtername', ...}
            %   name-value pair to the defaults cell array that is returned here.
            %
            %   The majority of paradigms perform some continuous signal processing (e.g. IIR
            %   frequency filtering), followed by extraction of epochs around target markers
            %   (implemented by the 'EpochExtraction' filter, see set_makepos.m), possibly followed
            %   by some further epoch-based signal processing (e.g. fourier transform). While it is
            %   possible to perform all processing on continuous data (in this case likely using a
            %   "target channel" instead of target markers), this is currently not a common practice
            %   in BCILAB, so it is more probable that the support for such processing is
            %   insufficiently documented and perhaps partially untested.
            %
            %   While this function defines the default signal processing setup, the user can
            %   partially or completely override the setup when he/she configures the paradigm into
            %   a custom approach (by passing a custom 'SignalProcessing' argument to the paradigm
            %   during calibration).
            
            % by default, here epochs of 1 second length will be extracted relative to the target
            % markers (beginning 0.5 seconds before each target marker, and ending 0.5 seconds after
            % it). See set_targetmarkers for an explanation of what a target marker is.

        end

            %
            % This function is called during calibration on the already pre-processed data. The
            % output of this function is a "featuremodel" struct that describes the parameters with
            % which feature extraction shall be done on the data for online processing (as well as
            % for the subsequent feature extraction during calibration, whose outputs feed into
            % machine learning). Any user parameters that shall go into feature extraction should be
            % declared here (using the arg_define() facility), as well as a parameter named 'Signal'
            % which is the pre-processed data. The signal may be used to adapt some of the feature-
            % extraction parameters in data-dependent (and possibly supervised, i.e. also
            % label-dependent) manner. See ParadigmCSP.m for a case with supervised feature adaptation
            % and ParadigmWindowmeans.m for a case without data-driven feature adaptation.

classdef ParadigmWindowmeans < ParadigmDataflowSimplified
    % Standard paradigm for slow cortical potentials, using per-channel multi-window signal averages.
    %
    % The windowed means paradigm is a general method for capturing slow-changing cortical potentials,
    % most importantly in reaction to events (then called Event-Related Potentials / ERPs). It is
    % comprehensively described in [1]; The default parameters match one of its first applications, in
    % [2].
    %
    % The paradigm is implemented as a sequence of signal (pre-)processing, feature extraction and
    % machine learing stages. Signal processing usually includes spectral filtering (e.g., lowpass
    % filtering) and occasionally spatial filtering, either for dimensionality reduction (e.g., by
    % selecting channels) or for the extraction of sparsity, independence or other feature qualities
    % (e.g., via independent component analysis). The defining property of the paradigm is the feature
    % extraction, in which windowed averages of (pre-processed) signal data, per channel, are computed
    % and used as features for the subsequent machine learning stage. The dimensionality of the feature
    % space is (# of channels) x (# of windows), which can easily be high enough to exceed the
    % capabilities of simpler classifiers or lead to over-fitting. For these reasons, either very robust
    % classifiers need to be used (such as shrinkage LDA or logistic regression) or strong assumptions
    % must be imposed in the machine learning stage (e.g. sparsity or group sparsity), or the number of
    % windows and channels must be carefully controlled / optimized. The paradigm can also be applied to
    % spectral data, by the use of the fourier filter (in one of the non-complex modes), possibly in
    % combination with the data selection filter. A related paradigm is para_dal_lf, and its
    % generalization para_dal, both of which do not require explicitly specified windows, but can
    % operate on raw data by means of their powerful regularization. The paradigm usually requires a
    % fair amount of manual (or automatic) tuning, in which the optimal window boundaries are determined
    % based on task data. Another parameter that is usually adapted to the task is the length and
    % location of the data epoch under consideration.
    %
    % The paradigm is widely applicable to event-related slow-changing brain dynamics, including, for
    % example, the perception of self-induced errors [3], machine-induced errors and/or suprisal [4,5],
    % prediction of movement intent [2], or (c)overt attention. It can also be used to detect brain
    % processes without a preceding event (i.e. asynchronously) when sufficient amounts of data from the
    % 'nothing'/'rest' condition is included in the calibration data.
    %
    % Simple Example: Consider the goal of predicting whether a person perceives an event as being
    % erroneous (and possibly unexpected), or not. A typical calibration data set for this task would
    % cover a sequence of events, some erroneous, some not, and each event is encoded in the data as an
    % EEGLAB event with type 'err' or 'noerr'. According to the literature [6,7], the assumptions is
    % that these types of events should be reflected in the EEG as a slow cortical potential (e.g., the
    % f-ERN) within 250ms to 600ms following the event. An appropriate predictive model could be
    % obtained as follows:
    %
    %   calib = io_loadset('data sets/john/errors.eeg')
    %   myapproach = {'Windowmeans' 'SignalProcessing', {'EpochExtraction',[0 0.8],'SpectralSelection',[0.1 15]}, ...
    %                 'Prediction',{'FeatureExtraction',{'TimeWindows',[0.25 0.3; 0.3 0.35; 0.35 0.4; 0.4 0.45; 0.45 0.55; 0.55 0.6]}}};
    %   [loss,model,stats] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach',myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'err','noerr'});
    %
    %
    % Complex Example: Consider the goal of anticipating a self-paced finger movement (for simplicity
    % only of one hand) of a person. A biological basis for this is the Bereitschaftspotential
    % (readiness potential, [8]). This is a difficult problems, since the detection should happen as
    % early as possible (especially before EMG onset), and because the detection should be reasonably
    % robust against false positives in an asynchronous setting. A possible calibration data set would
    % contain sporadic events in which the subject pressed a button ('press'), with periods of no
    % activity of varying length in between. Surrogate events will be placed in the data to mark epoch
    % windows of the two conditions 'no-press' and 'pre-press', using the function set_insert_markers.
    % Epochs will only be extracted for the surrogate events. Several pre-press data epochs will be
    % generated that end between 125ms to 100ms prior to each movement, and several no-press epochs will
    % be generated that lie well between any two movements. An IIR low-pass filter will be used due to
    % its low latency (replacing the paradigm's default FFT-based filter), and several fine-grained
    % windows will be placed at the very end (the "tip") of the epoch. In addition, several longer
    % "baseline" windows of different lengths will be placed in earlier parts of the epoch , to serve as
    % an adaptively chosen baseline (against which the tip of the epoch can be compared). Logistic
    % regression will be used as a classifier.
    %
    %   % load data with 'press' events
    %   calib = io_loadset('data sets/john/buttonpresses.eeg')
    %   % insert 7 'no-press' events safely between any two 'press' events
    %   calib = set_insert_markers(calib,'SegmentSpec',{'press' 3 -0.5 'press'}, 'Event','no-press', 'Count',7);
    %   % insert 7 'pre-press' events shortly before any 'press' event
    %   calib = set_insert_markers(calib,'SegmentSpec',{-0.125 -0.100 'press'}, 'Event','pre-press', 'Count',7);
    %   % define approach
    %   myapproach = {'Windowmeans' 'SignalProcessing', {'EpochExtraction',[-2 0],'SpectralSelection','off','IIRFilter',{[2.5 14],'lowpass'}}, ...
    %                 'Prediction',{'FeatureExtraction',{'TimeWindows',[-1.6 -0.5; -1.2 -0.5; -0.5 0.45; -0.2 -0.175; -0.025 0]}, ...
    %                               'MachineLearning',{'Learner',{'logreg'}}}};
    %   % learn a model
    %   [loss,model] = bci_train('Data',calib, 'Approach', myapproach, 'TargetMarkers',{'no-press','pre-press'})

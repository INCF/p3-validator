classdef ParadigmBaseSimplified < ParadigmBase
    % Simplified base class for BCI paradigms.
    %
    % Derive from this class if in your paradigm, calibration is done based on a single data set
    % (i.e. neither dataset collections nor stream bundles are handled meaningfully by it).
    % * you supply a calibrate_simple() function that takes a single recording and derives a model 
    %   from it (optionally specifying a filter chain for efficient pre-processing)
    % * you supply a predict_simple() function that takes a single data set and calculates outputs 
    %   from it
    % * (optionally, you may specify a visualization function)
    %
    %
    % If your paradigm can be understood as a dataflow model (i.e. a sequence of signal processing,
    % feature extraction, and machine learning), consider deriving from a simpler dataflow base class
    % instead (ParadigmDataflowSimplified).
    %
    % Notes:
    %   Most BCI paradigms (e.g., almost all from before 2008) do not support the full generality of
    %   possible inputs that are allowed by ParadigmBase (the general definition and implementation
    %   contract of a BCI paradigm, see ParadigmBase.m). Instead, firstly, most traditional BCI
    %   paradigms operate during online processing only on a single (multi-channel) signal instead
    %   of multiple concurrent signals, and secondly, most paradigms are initially calibrated based
    %   on a single calibration recording (usually a 30-60 minute recording of calibration data)
    %   instead of a (possibly tagged) collection of multiple data sets. For any such paradigm, the
    %   additional flexibility is useless and the corresponding organizational structure is an
    %   unnecessary implementation burden.
    %
    %   This base class is a refinement of ParadigmBase which omits the additional flexibility and
    %   provides an interface for simple paradigms. Any such paradigm should implement the
    %   calibrate_simple() method and the predict_simple() method, which are the simplified
    %   equivalents the calibrate() and predict() functions in ParadigmBase (without multiple
    %   concurrent streams and without multiple calibration data sets).
    %
    %   There exists a further specialization of this base class, ParadigmDataflowSimplified, which
    %   provides an additional layer of convenience for BCI paradigms that adhere to a standard 
    %   "dataflow" (multi-stage) structure. If a paradigm can be expressed as a sequence of signal 
    %   processing, feature extraction and machine learning, it is recommended to derive from this
    %   more specialized class instead (see ParadigmDataflowSimplified.m).

            % Model = calibrate_simple(Signal,Arguments...)
            %
            % This function defines how a BCI is calibrated (i.e. adapted) to an individual based on
            % a given calibration recording. The calibration recording is a single EEGLAB data set
            % (though may contain arbitrary signal contents) annotated with target markers that
            % contain information about the desired BCI output at various time points in the
            % recording. Based on these markers and the data a relationship between signal contents
            % and the value of some (assumed) 'cognitive state variable' (to be approximated by the
            % BCI's outputs) is inferred by this function and captured in the predictive model 
            % returned by it (a struct with any parameters necessary for predict_simple).
            %
            % Implementations of this function should declare at least a parameter named "Signal",
            % plus any desired custom user options. These parameters should be declared using the
            % arg_define() facility to allow the framework to query the parameter names and defaults
            % (e.g. for GUI display). The returned model also describes any signal (pre-)processing that
            % shall be performed by BCILAB before the predict_simple() function is called by it,
            % by means of its .filter_graph field.

            %             filter steps that is to be applied to the data, and is usually passed as either
            %             the .tracking.online_expression field of the processed Signal or the processed
            %             Signal itself. If no signal processing is performed by this paradigm, the raw
            %             signal may be passed.

            %
            %           The rest of the model struct is arbitrary and should contain whatever
            %           parameters are needed by predict_simple() to perform its operation.

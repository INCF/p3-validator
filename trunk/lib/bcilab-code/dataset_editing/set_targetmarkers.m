function signal = set_targetmarkers(varargin)
% Associate a subset of markers with a target value for prediction.
% Signal = set_targetmarkers(Signal,EventTypes)
%
% This function sets up an association between events in a data set (with a specific type) on one
% hand and values that a BCI is supposed to predict (called "target values"). It is the primary way
% by which the desired output of a BCI for some data is defined. Note: this function is typically
% called by bci_train (according to its TargetMarkers parameter).
%
% After events have been annotated with this function, a BCI approach calibrated on this data set
% may extract epochs of data around these "target" events and learn a mapping that predicts the
% respective target value whenever it encounters data effectively similar to the segments/epochs
% that had that target value associated with them in the calibration data. This way, events that
% denote a particular user condition in the data can be assigned a concrete value that a BCI should
% output whenever the user is in that condition again.
%
% The function effectively adds a .target field to the events in the data set, and sets it to desired
% value for those events that are selected in either EventTypes or EventMap. The remaining events 
% will have an empty target field.
%
% In:
%   Signal     : continuous EEGLAB data set which shall be annotated with target markers
%
%   EventTypes : Cell array of event types (strings) that encode a prediction target value 
%                (i.e. a condition of interest).
%
%                The order in which marker types are supplied determines the corresponding associated
%                target value of each. For example, if this is {'xxx' 'dfg' 'yyy'}, all events with 
%                type 'yyy' will be assigned a target value of 3, while those with type 'dfg' will 
%                receive target value of 2, etc. (i.e., the target value is the index of the 
%                event type, as it appears in the cell array).
%
%                To assign the same target value to events of multiple types, group them into a
%                nested cell array, e.g., {'xxx' {'dfg' 'blah'} 'yyy'} -- here, the assignment
%                from event type to target value is as follows: xxx -> 1, dfg -> 2, blah -> 2, yyy -> 3.
%
%   EventMap : Alternative specification of the mapping from event type to target value; given 
%              as a cell array of {'type1',value1,'type2',value2,'type3',value3} where the respective
%              type denotates an event type, and the value is the target value that will be associated
%              with each event of the respective type.
%
% Out:
%   Signal : data set with "target" annotations added to the events of interest (.target field added)
%            (continuous or epoched)
%
% Examples:
%   % annotate all events of type 'TX' with target value 1 and all events of type 'TY' with target value 2
%   eeg = set_targetmarkers(eeg,{'TX','TY'})
%   
%   % as before, but assign target value 1 to 'TY' events and 2 to 'TX' events
%   eeg = set_targetmarkers(eeg,{'TY','TX'})
%
%   % as before, but assign target value 1 to both 'TX' and 'TY' events, assign target value 2
%   % to 'TZ' events, and 3 to 'A' and 'B' events.
%   eeg = set_targetmarkers(eeg,{{'TY','TX'},'TZ',{'A','B'}})
%
%   % as before, but using named arguemnts
%   eeg = set_targetmarkers('Signal',eeg, 'EventTypes',{{'TY','TX'},'TZ',{'A','B'}})
%
%   % as before, but express it in the alternative EventMap specification
%   eeg = set_targetmarkers('Signal',eeg, 'EventMap',{'A',3, 'B',3, 'TX',1, 'TY',1, 'TZ',2})
%
%   % use some fairly arbitrary target values this time
%   eeg = set_targetmarkers('Signal',eeg, 'EventMap',{'A',0.75, 'B',-2, 'TX',1000,'TY',1001})

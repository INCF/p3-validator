function signal = set_makepos(varargin)
% Create epochs relative to the target markers in a data set.
% Signal = set_makepos(Signal,TimeWindow)
%
% This function turns a continuous data set with "target" markers (aka target events), i.e. events
% that have a .target field which contains a non-empty "target value" into an epoched data set,
% creating one epoch relative to each target marker, and copying that markers's .target value into the
% respective epoch's .target field. Target markers are created via the function set_targetmarkers.
%
% In:
%   Signal      :   continuous data set from which epochs shall be extracted
%
%   TimeWindow  :   time window relative to the events (forming the extracted epoch), in seconds
%
% Out:
%   Signal  :  epoched data set, with target variable assigned; changes:
%              - data is reformatted into a 3d array
%              - xmin & xmax indicate the epoch bounds in seconds
%              - events are rewritten to be relative to epochs (urevents unaffected)
%              - times contains the time points inside the epoch
%
% Notes:
%   In the regular BCILAB processing pipeline, target markers are defined on the continuous 
%   data set either automatically by the bci_ functions, or manually via set_targetmarkers.
%
% Examples:
%   % extract epochs from a continuous data set, beginning 0.5s before the position of each marker
%   % and ending 1.5s after the position of the corresponding marker
%   eeg = set_makepos(eeg,[-0.5 1.5])
%
%   % as before, but first add target markers for event types 'X' and 'Y'
%   eeg = set_makepos(set_targetmarkers(eeg,{'X','Y'}),[-0.5 1.5])

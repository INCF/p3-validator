function result = par_reschedule_policy(batchid,inflight,waiting,times,msgs)
% Default re-scheduling policy for the Java-based Scheduler.
% Reschedule = par_reschedule_policy(Batch-Id,Inflight-Ids,Event-Times,Event-Messages)
%
% This function is periodically invoked by the Scheduler with a list of recent events (times in ms
% and content encoded as strings) and tags of in-flight tasks. It is expected to issue the
% re-scheduling of starved or lost tasks (out of those that are in-flight), depending on some
% assumptions.
%
% In:
%   Batch-Id     : Identifier of the current batch of tasks (this policy may be invoked for multiple
%                  possibly overlapping schedules).
%
%   Inflight-Ids : Cell array of Ids/Tags of in-flight tasks (same as in the Event-Msgs)
%
%   Waiting-Ids : Cell array of Ids/Tags of waiting tasks (same as in the Event-Msgs)
%
%   Event-Times  : Cell array of event timestamps in miliseconds (since beginning of the Scheduler's
%                  current batch of tasks).
%
%   Event-Messages: Cell array of event content, indexed like Event-Times.
%
% Out:
%   Reschedule : Java Vector of Integers, referring to the Inflight-Ids that shall be rescheduled
%                (or the empty Vector).
%
% Notes:
%   A log of what is was rescheduled when is collected in the global variable 
%   tracking.temp.rescheduled.

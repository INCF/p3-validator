function pool = par_getworkers_ssh(varargin)
% Acquire workers on some remote machines and return hostnames and ports of those that are available.
% Pool = par_getworkers_ssh(Hostnames,ProcessorsPerNode,MatlabThreads,StartupCommand,ShareResources,SharingPort,LoggingPath,IdentityFile,BinaryWorker,BinaryNmae,MatlabCompilerRoot,MinFreeMemory,MaxCPULoad,LoadWindow,AvoidProcess,RecruitMachines,VerboseOutput)
%
% This function attempts to ensure that the desired number of worker processes on remote machines
% is available for participating in distributed computations. Such computations are usually being
% submitted in the form of tasks to the respective worker processes, via the function par_schedule.
%
% Alternatively, the workers can also be started manually on the remote machines (this is the 
% recommended way if Windows machines are involved or use of SSH is not permitted) and their names
% would then just be listed in the cluster settings (rather than to configure acquisition behavior).
%
% In:
%   --- what shall be acquired ---
%
%   Hostnames : cell array of hostnames on which to acquire workers (duplicates and port assignments
%               will be ignored).
%
%   ProcessorsPerNode : number of processes to acquire per node; 0 means as many as there are cores
%                       on each node, divided by the value of the 'matlabthreads' parameter
%                       (default: 0)
%
%   MatlabThreads : assumed number of threads per MATLAB instance (default: 4)
%
%   --- how shall it be acquired ---
%
%   StartupCommand : startup command, if any; if binary_worker is true, this is a sequence of shell 
%                    commands, otherwise it is a sequence of MATLAB statements which contain the
%                    placeholder %d where the TCP port # would be inserted; If the startup_command
%                    is passed as 'autogenerate', a bcilab-specific startup command will be
%                    generated (default: 'autogenerate')
%
%   ShareResources : whether worker that are already running will be returned as part of the worker 
%                    set, and are thus potentially shared with other users. If false, the requested
%                    number of workers will always be started and be private to the requester -
%                    however, potentially over-subscribing the node. (default: true)
%
%   SharingPort : the starting port for shared workers; if 0, this is a hash of the startup_command 
%                 (default: 0)
%
%   --- associated files ---
%
%   LoggingPath : default logfile path; make sure that this does not conflict with other users' log 
%                 paths. (default: '')
%
%   IdentityFile : SSH identity file, if needed (implying the -i option for ssh) (default: '')
%   
%   --- optional binary worker support ---
%
%   BinaryWorker : whether to use assume a binary worker implementation rather than the MATLAB 
%                  worker (default: false)
%
%   BinaryName : name of the worker binary (default: 'build')
%
%   MatlabCompilerRoot : installation path of the MATLAB compiler runtime; if empty, a few locations 
%                        will be searched for an MCR that corresponds to the MATLAB version that is
%                        running this function. If nothing is found, it is assumed that the MCR has
%                        been installed into the system path  and is found automatically. (default: '')
%
%   --- exclusion criteria ---
%
%   MinMemory : minimum memory (in bytes) that needs to be available for an instance to be started 
%               (default: 4GB)
%
%   MaxCPULoad : maximum acceptable average CPU load (summed over all cores) for a node to be 
%                considered (default: Inf)
%
%   LoadWindow : CPU load measurement window, in minutes; can be 1, 5 or 15 (default: 15)
%
%   AvoidProcess : avoid nodes with the given process running (default: 'avoidme')
%
%   ShutdownTimeout : if non-zero, the worker will shut itself down if it has not received a
%                     heartbeat signal from a client in the given time, in seconds. (default: 0)
%
%   RecruitMachines : whether to recruit other machines, rather than just list them (default: true)
%
%
%   --- misc ---
%
%   VerboseOutput : whether to show verbose outputs during acquisition (default: true)
%
%
% Out:
%   Pool : cell array of 'hostname:port' strings specifying the list of available machines
%          Note: in the case that no return value is requested, the global variable 
%                tracking.parallel.pool will receive this result. This is the recommended way to
%                use par_getworkers_ssh, as par_schedule uses this pool by default.
%
% Notes:
%   If workers are shared between users, code which maintains global state (in particular
%   user-specific configuration options) may show unexpected behavior, as these variables are not
%   duplicated across users.
%
%   If resources are not shared, it must be considered that each call to par_getworkers_ssh will launch
%   another set of worker processes on the target nodes; there is no mechanism in place to
%   automatically terminate the remote workers when the MATLAB session ends.
%
%   This function works only across POSIX-compliant (Unix/Linux/Mac) systems. On standard Windows
%   workstations, the workers must be started manually (unless POSIX emulation software is
%   installed).
%
% Examples:
%   % acquire workers on the three hosts (assuming bcilab is in the same file-system location remotely as here)
%   par_getworkers_ssh({'machine1','machine2','machine3'})
%
%   % try to start fast pre-compiled workers (assuming bcilab is in the same file-system location remotely as here)
%   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'binary_worker',true)
%
%   % MATLAB version again, also setting a custom logging path
%   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'logging_path','/home/christian/workerlogs/')
%
%   % like before, but this time only consider machines that have at least 8GB of free RAM and at most 10% CPU load
%   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'logging_path','/home/christian/workerlogs/', 'min_memory',2^33, 'max_cpuload',0.1)
%
%   % like before, but measuring the CPU load within the last minute (instead to 15 minutes)
%   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'logging_path','/home/christian/workerlogs/', 'min_memory',2^33, 'max_cpuload',0.1, 'load_window',1)
%
%   % acquire workers on the three hosts, this time using a custom startup command (the %d is where the port goes)
%   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'},'startup_command','cd path/to/bcilab/; bcilab(''myconfig'',''worker'',{%d,1}')
%
%   % try to start fast pre-compiled workers (instead of entire MATLAB sessions); note that the 
%   % startup command is this time a UNIX shell command which CD's into the directory where the run_build.sh is located
%   par_getworkers_ssh('hostnames', {'machine1','machine2','machine3'}, 'binary_worker',true, 'startup_command','cd path/to/bcilab/build/distrib')

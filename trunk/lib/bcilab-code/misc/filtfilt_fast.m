function X = filtfilt_fast(varargin)
% Like filtfilt(), but faster when filter and signal are long (and A=1).
% Y = filtfilt_fast(B,A,X)
%
% Uses FFT convolution (needs fftfilt). The function is faster than filter when approx. length(B)>256 and size(X,Dim)>1024, 
% otherwise slower (due size-testing overhead).
%
% Note:
%  Can also be called with four arguments, as Y = filtfilt_fast(N,F,A,X), 
%  in which case an Nth order FIR filter is designed that has the desired frequency response A at normalized frequencies F;
%  F must be 0<=F<=1, and must be 0 and 1 at its both ends, respectively. The function fir2 is used for frequency-sampling filter design.

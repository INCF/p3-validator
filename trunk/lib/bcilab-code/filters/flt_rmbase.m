% Baseline correction is a commonly used method in the analysis of Event-Related Potentials, to
% factor out irrelevant variations in a signal's baseline. It is applied to an epoched data set, by
% specifying a sub-window that (typically) lies before the phenomena of interest, where the mean
% signal value in that window is subtracted from the entire signal (per channel or component).
% Baseline considerations are relevant for BCIs operating on slow cortical potentials, and can be
% implemented in a variety of other ways, too. One is to use a highpass filter (flt_iir, flt_fir,
% flt_select) to subtract low-frequency drifts in the signal. Another one is to add features from
% the signal which measure the baseline, for example one or a collection of windows of various
% lengths prior to the phenomenon of interest (in this case, the baseline correction is done by the
% machine learning algorithm that operates on these features). Paradigms which assign different
% weights for every time point in an epoch typically do baseline correction implicitly.
%
% In:
%   Signal          :   epoched data set to be processed
%
%   BaselineWindow  :   baseline window in seconds, e.g. [-0.5 -0.3]
%
% Out: 
%   Signal  :   baseline-corrected data set
%
% Examples:
%   % remove the baseline of a continuous or epoched data set
%   eeg = flt_rmbase(eeg)
%
%   % in an epoched signal, subtract the average of the signal from 250ms before the time-locking 
%   % event to 100ms after the time-locking event
%   eeg = flt_rmbase(eeg,[-0.25 0.1])
%
%   % pass the arguments by name
%   eeg = flt_rmbase('Signal'eeg,'BaselineWindow',[-0.25 0.1])

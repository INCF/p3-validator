function signal = flt_stationary(varargin)
% Restrict an epoched signal to an n-dimensional stationary subspace
% Signal = flt_stationary(Signal, StationaryDim)
%
% This is an implementation of the Analytical Stationary Subspace Analysis algorithm [1]. Typically,
% it is applied to continuous data with a block length that is large enough to average over changes
% in the experimental conditions (if presented in a randomized bock design), e.g. 30 seconds.
%
% The data typically needs to be high-pass filtered prior to use, since otherwise drifts will
% dominate the results. The filter may also be applied to epoched data, in which case the epochs are 
% taken as the blocks.
%
% In:
%   Signal        : continuous data set to be filtered
%
%   StationaryDim : assumed number of stationary sources; if a negative number is given, it is taken
%                   as the assumed number of non-stationary sources; may also be given as a ratio,
%                   in which case it is understood as a fraction of the number of channels (default: -0.15)
%
%   BlockLength   : length of the signal blocks across which non-stationarity should be assessed,
%                   in seconds; may also be an [Nx2] array of intervals that should be taken as blocks
%                   (default: 30)
%
%   Operation     : Operation to perform; can be one of the following:
%                   * 'keep_stationary': project the signal onto the stationary components
%                   * 'keep_nonstationary': project the signal onto the non-stationary components
%                   * 'separate': order the signal by increasing non-stationarity of its components
%                   * 'backproject_stationary': back-project the stationary components onto the channels
%                   * 'backproject_nonstationary': back-project the non-stationary components onto the channels
%
% Out:
%   Signal        :  filtered, EEGLAB data set
%
% Examples:
%   % use default settings to remove the 10 least stationary components of the signal
%   eeg = flt_stationary(eeg);
%
%   % retain a 20-dimensional maximally stationary subspace, as measured across blocks of 15 seconds length
%   eeg = flt_stationary(eeg,20,15)
%
%   % as before, but passing arguments by name
%   eeg = flt_stationary('Signal',eeg,'StationaryDim',20,'BlockLength',15)
%
%   % as before, but this time retain all except for a 20-dimensional maxially non-stationary subpace 
%   eeg = flt_stationary('Signal',eeg,'StationaryDim',-20,'BlockLength',15)
%
%   % as before, but now back-project the retained subspace onto the channels (giving a rank-deficit signal)
%   eeg = flt_stationary('Signal',eeg,'StationaryDim',-20,'BlockLength',15,'Operation','backproject_stationary')

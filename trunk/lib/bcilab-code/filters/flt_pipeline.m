function signal = flt_pipeline(varargin)
% Configurable preprocessing pipeline for most BCI paradigms.
% Signal = flt_pipeline(Signal, Stages...)
%
% Most BCI paradigms contain a sequence of signal processing steps, many of which are common to a
% variety of paradigms (for example, spatial and spectral filtering). The default Signal Processing
% pipeline allows to restrict the raw sensor signals to the contents of interest, such as, for
% example, specific frequency bands (e.g., the alpha band), or specific spatial areas (e.g. signals
% emitted from the motor cortex). This can be viewed as a way to improve the signal-to-noise ratio
% (for some notion of what is the signal) of the data, or as a way to express and incorporate prior
% knowledge into the paradigm.
%
%
% Direct Use
% ==========
%
% With no options, flt_pipeline returns the input signal unprocessed. By giving options, various
% pipeline stages can be enabled. By default, the stages are automatically ordered according to 
% whatever constraints and ordering hints they declare (which covers 99% of cases, though the order
% can be manually and selectively overridden), and the order in which they are passed to flt_pipeline
% does not matter. If a pipeline stage is listed multiple times, only the last assignment is 
% effective.
%
% Each pipeline stage can be referred to by various names (among other for backwards compatibility),
% including a) the name of the function (without the flt_ / set_ prefix), b) the name that shows 
% up in the GUI (e.g. SpectralTransform for flt_fourier), and c) in some cases a legacy short-cut 
% name, e.g. 'epoch' for set_makepos).
%
% The canonical way of enabling pipeline stages is by passing the name of the stage, followed by a
% cell array containing the list of arguments to be passed to the respective function, excluding the
% data set itself (which would come from whatever stage was before). Thus, the argument format is
% determined by the respective stage function (see examples in the function's help). An example is
% flt_pipeline('signal',eeg, 'iir',{'Frequencies',[0.5 2],'Mode','highpass'})
% 
% In addition, there are some shortcuts if only a single parameter that is not a cell array is
% passed to the respective stage. In this case, the parameter can usually be passed without the
% enclosing cell array, for example as in flt_pipeline('signal',eeg,'resample',300,'iir',[5 7 25 30]). 
% It is also possible to turn on or off a pipeline stage by passing the string 'on' or 'off'.
%
% The function automatically scans the filter and dataset_editing folders and passes the arguments
% on to the respective functions.
%
%
% Use in a BCI paradigm function
% ==============================
%
% As many BCI paradigms make use of a signal processing pipeline, flt_pipeline is most frequently
% used within BCI paradigms (within their preprocessing code). BCI paradigms might expose a subset
% of the filter pipeline's arguments as their own user parameters, or they might expose the entire
% parameter set of flt_pipeline to the user, typically with some pre-defined paradigm-specific 
% settings, so that the user can customize the entire pipeline. In particular, the function 
% para_dataflow is a template BCI paradigm which exposes the entire pipeline as its 'flt' or 
% 'SignalProcessing' argument (this is a cell array of flt_pipeline arguments), and the majority of 
% BCI paradigms are wrappers around this function (only changing some default stages).
%
% In this case, there is already a default assignment for a subset of the pipeline stage parameters,
% and the user can selectively override the defaults, for example, by passing 
% 'SignalProcessing',{'EpochExtraction',{...}} to change only the epoch extraction behavior of the
% paradigm. To disable a stage that is by default enabled by a paradigm, simply pass [],
% e.g. 'SignalProcessing',{'Resampling',[]} or 'off' to disable the respective stage. To turn a 
% stage on without passing any particular parameters, pass either {} or 'on'.
%
%
% Writing compatible stages
% =========================
%
% To be a compatible stage recognized by flt_pipeline, a function needs to:
% a) be in the directory code/filters or code/dataset_editing and begin with flt_ or set_
% b) use the argument declaration system (i.e., arg_define) to declare its arguments
% c) declare at least one argument named 'signal', which is the signal to be processed
%    and when returning a second output (the state), accept an optional argument called 'state'
% d) preferably use the expression system (i.e. exp_beginfun and exp_endfun)
% e) preferably declare at least a minimal set of ordering hints (using declare_properties)
% f) preferably declare a human-readable 'name' property in CamelCase (using declare_properties)
%
% 
% Filter Ordering
% ===============
%
% Each filter in BCILAB declares a small set of ordering hints which
% describes its required or preferred ordering with respect to other
% filters. This is to save users the hassle of figuring out the optimal
% filter order themselves in the majority of cases.
%
% For example, a filter that can only be applied on continuous but
% not segmented data would specify that it cannot follow the filter stage
% that turns a continuous signal into a segmented signal (which is the 
% function set_makepos). Generally, these ordering hints are expressed
% in the filter function (e.g. flt_iir) using a line as in the example:
%
%   declare_properties('cannot_follow','set_makepos', 'follows','flt_resample')
%  
% Aside from the two hard ordering constraints 'cannot_follow' and
% 'cannot_precede', a third one is the hard 'depends' constraint, which 
% expresses that a particular filter stage must have been applied
% beforehand -- for example, dipole fitting (for independent components) 
% can only be performed after independent components have been derived in 
% the first place, which is done by the filter flt_ica.
%
% Lastly, a filter may express also "soft" ordering preferences (and many
% do), for example because certain orders may be computationally more 
% efficient or because a higher-quality result can be attained in a certain 
% order. The two soft preferences are 'precedes' and 'follows'. For
% example, many filters prefer to be applied after the resampling stage
% (flt_resample) rather than before, in order to save computation time 
% (as resampling usually reduces the amount of data to process). Another 
% example are frequency-domain transforms (flt_fourier and flt_coherence), 
% which are most useful when applied to data that is spatially filtered
% rather than to the raw channel signals. Thus, these filters prefer to be
% applied after at least flt_ica and flt_project. Because many filters
% contribute such constraints or preferences (which can be visualized as 
% directed edges between filter nodes), the final order is fairly well 
% determined. 
%
% If a different ordering is required than the default (which can be looked
% up in the GUI edit panel of any paradigm that uses flt_pipeline -- that is
% most of them), then one many partially override the order by passing a 
% cell array of filter names as the parameter FilterOrdering. This is
% interpreted as a set of additional hard ordering constraints between any
% pair of filters in the list. Generally, the user-specified ordering and
% the hard constraints take precedence over the preferences, but hard
% constraints can not conflict (e.g., one cannot force a continuous-data
% filter to be applied after set_makepos but gets an error instead). 
%
% Lastly, only filters that specify at least one ordering hint are managed
% by flt_pipeline (possibly a reason why a hastily written filter may not
% show up in the GUI).
%
%
% In:
%   Signal     : a data set to be processed (as, e.g., loaded with io_loadset)
%
%   Stages... : optional name-value pairs that enable various stages of the default preprocessing
%               pipeline. In the following, the most common default stages are listed with some 
%               examples:
%
%                'Resampling'/'resample'/'srate' (see flt_resample):
%                   resample to the given sampling rate, in Hz; 
%
%                   Example: resample to 200 Hz
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'resample',200,...)
%
%
%                'Rereferencing'/'reref'/'ref' (see flt_reref):
%                   re-reference the data to a set of channel(s); 
%
%                   Example: resample to the average of 'TP7' and 'TP8' channels
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'Rereferencing',{{'TP7','TP8'}},...)
%
%                   Example: do a common average reference
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'Rereferencing',{[]},...)
%
%
%                'ICA'/'ica' (see flt_ica):
%                   annonatate the data set with an independent component analysis decomposition
%
%                   Example: use the default settings
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'ICA','on',...), 
%
%                   Example: use a 3-models amica, and use 16 nodes on the cluster, using 'hardcore' cleaning
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'ICA',{'Variant',{'amica','NumModels',3,'NumProcessors',16},'CleaningLevel','hardcore'}...)
%
%
%                'ChannelSelection'/'selchans'/'channels' (see flt_selchans): 
%                   select a channel subset, typically a cell-string array 
%                   
%                   Example: select channels C3 and C4
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'ChannelSelection',{{'C3' 'C4'}},...)
%
%
%                'SurfaceLaplacian'/'laplace' (see flt_laplace):
%                   simple Hjorth-style surface laplacian
%
%                   Example: use the default settings
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'laplace','on',...)
%
%
%                'IIRFilter'/'iir' (see flt_iir): 
%                   apply an IIR-based frequency filter
%
%                   Example: implement an 8-30 Hz band-pass filter
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'iir',[7 8 29 31],...)
%
%                   Example: implement an 1 Hz high-pass filter (with generous transition band)
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'iir',{[0.5 1.5],'highpass'},...)
%
%                   Example: implement an 1 Hz high-pass filter, passing the flt_iir arguments by name
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'iir',{'Frequencies',[0.5 1.5], 'Mode','highpass'},...)
%
%
%                'FIRFilter'/'fir' (see flt_fir): 
%                   apply an FIR-based frequency filter
%
%                   Example: implement an 1 Hz minimum-phase high-pass filter
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'fir',{[0.5 1.5],'highpass','minimum-phase'}, ...)
%
%                'Standardization'/'standardize' (see flt_standardize): 
%                   standardize the channels using a window of past signal
%
%                   Example: standardize using a moving 60-second window
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'Standardization',60,...)
%
%                'EpochExtraction'/'makepos'/'epoch' (see set_makepos): 
%                   Extract epochs from the signal (and deduce a target variable from the time-
%                   locking event types) (see set_makepos).
%
%                   Example: extract epochs around each occurrence of marker 'keypress1' and 
%                            'keypress2', cutting out segments that begin 2s before the marker and
%                            end 1s after the marker (note: keypress1 epochs will be assigned class 1
%                            and keypress2 epochs are being assigned class 2)
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'epoch',{[-2 1],{'keypress1','keypress2'}},...)
%
%                   Example: as before, but assign class 1 to keypress2 and class 2 to keypress1
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'epoch',{[-2 1],{'keypress2','keypress1'}},...)
%
%                   Example: assign class 1 to epochs around marker 'stimulus', and class 2 to epochs
%                            around markers 'keypress1' or 'keypress2'
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'epoch',{[-2 1],{'stimulus',{'keypress2','keypress1'}}},...)
%           
%                'BaselineRemoval'/'rmbase'/'baseline' (see flt_rmbase): 
%                   remove a baseline window of the given epoch(s)
%
%                   Example: for each epoch, average the signal value within -250ms to +100ms around 
%                            the time-locking event, and subtract that value from the entire epoch
%                            for the respective channel
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'BaselineRemoval',[-0.25 0.1],...)
%
%                'WindowSelection'/'window' (see flt_window): 
%                   apply a window function
%                   
%                   Example: scale each epoch in the data by a hann time window 
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'window','hann',...), 
%
%                   Example: restrict each epoch to the interval within 0 to 0.5 seconds after the 
%                            respective time-locking event
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'window',[0 0.5],...)
%
%                'SpectralSelection'/'spectrum' (see flt_spectrum): 
%                   apply a free-form spectral filter per epoch (note: if no epochs are present, this 
%                   gives a non-causal filtering of the entire signal)
%
%                   Example: apply a 7-30 Hz band-pass filter with linear falloffs at both edges
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'spectrum',[6.5 7.5 27 33],...)
%
%                'SparseReconstruction'/'reconstruct' (see flt_reconstruct): 
%                   reconstruct the signal in terms of a new (possibly overcomplete) basis
%
%                   Example: reconstruct the data in a random overcomplete basis using a fast EM method
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'reconstruct',{randn(32,1000), 'variant','FastEM'},...)
%
%                'ProjectionMatrix'/'project' (see flt_project): 
%                   apply a custom spatial projection matrix to the signal
%
%                   Example: project the data according to a random matrix
%                   flt_pipeline(X,...,'project',randn(128),...)
%
%                'SpectralTransform'/'fourier' (see flt_fourier):
%                   transform (usually epoched) signal into a Fourier representation 
%
%                   Example: flt_pipeline(X,...,'fourier','amplitude',...)
%
%
%                In addition, flt_pipeline provides afew of its own special-purpose parameters which
%                are not pipeline stages by themselves:
%
%                'FilterOrdering' : cell string array to partially override the default order
%                                   for the given pipeline stage functions. (e.g. {'set_makepos','flt_iir'})
%
%
% Out:
%   Signal  : the processed data set
%
% Examples:
%   % resample, apply an IIR high-pass filter and extract epochs (here: using short param names)
%   eeg = flt_pipeline(eeg, 'resample',200, 'iir',{[0.5 1],'highpass'}, 'epoch',[-1 1]);
%
%   % apply a surface laplacian and do an ICA decomposition, keeping the defaults for both stages
%   % (here: using the long parameter names)
%   eeg = flt_pipeline(eeg, 'SurfaceLaplacian',{}, 'ICA',{});
%
%   % as before, but use the 'on' syntax, instead of the cell array syntax
%   eeg = flt_pipeline(eeg, 'SurfaceLaplacian','on', 'ICA','on');
%
%   % assuming a function that runs flt_pipeline, but pre-specifies some of its own defaults internally,
%   % while allowing to customize/override all of its pipeline stage defaults, override the IIR filter parameters,
%   % and turn off the ICA decomposition (assuming that it was on as per defaults of specialpipeline())
%   eeg = specialpipeline(eeg, 'IIRFilter',{'[0.5 2],'highpass'}, 'ICA','off')
%
%   % as before, but use the [] syntax to turn off a pipeline stage
%   eeg = specialpipeline(eeg, 'IIRFilter',{'[0.5 2],'highpass'}, 'ICA',[])
%
%   % note: specialpipeline may be implemented as follows:
%   function signal = specialpipeline(signal,varargin)
%   ...
%   signal = flt_pipeline(signal,'IIRFilter',[5 7 25 30], 'ICA','on', varargin{:})

function onl_append(name, chunk, stamp)
% Append a block of raw data to a stream.
% onl_append(Name, Chunk, Timestamp)
%
% The number of columns in the appended data block must match the number of channels in the stream,
% and the data must have been sampled at the rate specified in the stream's .srate field.
% Predictions are always being made with respect to the most recently appended sample.
%
% The sequence of samples fed into a stream (over the course of multiple calls to onl_append) must
% have no omissions (i.e., samples must not be skipped) or repetitions (i.e., samples that have been
% supplied in a previous call must not be fed again). If samples are not available from the data
% source or were missed (for whatever reason), the corresponding number of zero-valued samples
% should be fed).
%
% Processing (i.e., appending samples and calculating predictions from them) does not have to happen
% in real time (i.e., the actual wall-clock time does not affect the calulated results).
%
% In:
%   Name : variable name of the stream to which the data should be appended
%
%   Chunk : [#Channels x #Samples] matrix of raw data
%
%   Timestamp : optional time stamp for the last sample in the chunk, in seconds, in some arbitary
%               time domain which is consistent across all streams used by dependent predictors
%               (default: computed from xmin)
%
% Notes:
%   For many applications, accurate time codes are not necessary for reasonably good performance (or
%   not worth the development burden). For some applications, accurate timing across streams is
%   essential (especially if the relative lags are significant and temporal structure across streams
%   is being used for predictions). In this case, the time codes should be reasonably precise
%   estimates of the time stamp of the last sample, in a time domain that is the same across all
%   streams that are being used by a given predictor. This can be seconds since startup, or, for
%   example, the estimated (negative) age of the sample.
%
% Examples:
%   % get a chunk of new data from a device and append it to a (previously created) online stream
%   mychunk = get_data_from_device();
%   onl_append('mystream',mychunk);

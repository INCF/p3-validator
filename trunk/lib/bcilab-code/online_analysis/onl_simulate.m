% Apply a predictive model to some raw data set at specified time points.
% [Predictions,Latencies] = onl_simulate(Data,Model,Markers,Latencies,SamplingRate,Shift,Format,Interval,Waitbar,Feedback)
% 
% 
% The function onl_simulate is the standard way in BCILAB to apply predictive models to data sets,
% i.e. to receive predictions of cognitive state at various specified time points in the given data
% set. The data set must be unfiltered, but it may have been structurally edited (e.g. chanlocs,
% dipfit, etc.), The model is usually one that has been previously computed using bci_train (see
% bci_train) on some calibration data set (note that predictions on the calibration data set itself
% result in overly optimistic estimates, and are usually scientifically invalid results).
% 
% The time points at which the model shall be invoked can be specified in flexible ways: among
% others, a model can be invoked at certain specified latencies ('Samples'), at a given rate
% ('SamplingRate'), or relative to events of certain types ('Markers'). Generally, a constant offset
% can be added to the specified time points, which is important when classifying relative to certain
% stimulus events: usually the data necessary for the prediction is only fully available at some
% time after the stimulus event (as a rule of thumb: when a model was calibrated relative to events,
% using an epoch clause which ended x seconds past the event, then this is the amount of time that
% needs to be specified as the offset (converted in samples).
% 
% The predictions produced by onl_simulate are of the same format as those produced by bci_predict
% and ml_predict (and may depend on how the model was calibrated), see bci_predict for an
% explanation of the most common case(s).
%
% onl_predict uses the online infrastructure of the toolbox to produce its results (and can
% currently not be used while online processing is in progress in the current MATLAB instance).
% Therefore, the outputs are exactly identical to what would be computed by the model if it was
% applied in real time. The analysis done by onl_simulate is typically called "pseudo-online
% analysis", since the data is actually streamed (causally) through the processing chain in a
% simulated online fashion. In contrast, the related bci_predict does what is often called "offline
% analysis", in which the data is processed not necessarily causally in successive stages, and
% predictions are obtained in a trial-by-trial fashion, not in a time-point-by-time-point fashion;
% offline analysis typically involves known desired outputs, against which the predictions of the
% model are compared, to get loss estimates. The framework of bci_predict is designed to give
% identical results to what would be computed by onl_simulate in the respective situations (e.g. at
% the time points of certain events), but the data processing is generally more efficient (for
% example, intermediate results can be cached in memory or on disk, whereas onl_simulate usually
% processes the data in small chunks). For these reasons, onl_simulate is the preferred method when
% details of the time course of a model's output are required (e.g. how it behaves in the proximity
% of events or in areas of the data where unknown cognitive processes take place), and/or when it
% must be 100% certain that the model can be applied online as-is. bci_predict is the preferred
% method when high-throughput offline analyses on certain constrained portions of the data (e.g.
% relative to events) need to be executed as efficiently as possible (e.g. in batch analyses).

%
% In:
%   Data         : raw EEGLAB data set that shall be streamed through the online pipeline,
%                  or stream bundle, or cell array of EEGLAB data sets
%
%   Model        : the predictive model (as produced by bci_train) that should be used to make
%                  predictions at certain latencies in the data (specified in the Options)
%
%   Markers      : predict when an event appears whose type matches any of the markers
%
%   SamplingRate : predict at the given sampling rate (in Hz)
%
%   Latencies    : predict at the given data sample latencies (if multiple streams are passed this is 
%                  measured by the rate of the first stream)
%
%   Shift        : add this offset (in seconds) to the times at which the predictive model is invoked 
%
%   Format       : format of the prediction; see utl_formatprediction (default: 'distribution')
%
%   Interval     : process only this interval of the data, in seconds (if both ends <= 1, assume
%                  that the interval is a fraction) (default: [0 1])
%   
%   Waitbar      : whether to display a progress update (default: 0) 
%   
%   Feedback     : whether to display a bar diagram for every prediction (default: 0)
%
%   TightenBuffer: whether to tighten the stream buffer for increased speed (default: false)
%                  note: if this is true, the resulting processing times are not representative of
%                        actual online processing speed
%
% Out:
%   Predictions : the prediction results for every point at which the detector should be invoked
%
%   Latencies   : data set points for the corresponding predictions (in seconds)
%
% Notes:
%   NaN outputs are generated at time points where no prediction could be made (e.g. too close to data 
%   set boundaries).
%
% Examples:
%  % 1. load calibration data and compute a model (see bci_train)
%  calib = io_loadset('data sets/mary/stresslevels_calib.signal');
%  [loss,model] = bci_train({'data',calib,'paradigm',@para_speccsp},'events',{'low','medium','high'});
%
%  % 2. apply pseudo-online, here at a rate of 5 Hz
%  testdata = io_loadset('data sets/mary/stresslevels_realworld.signal');
%  [predictions,latencies] = onl_simulate(testdata, model, 'SamplingRate',5);
%
%  % 3. plot time course of the model's output
%  plot(latencies, predictions{2}*predictions{3}); title('expected stress level');

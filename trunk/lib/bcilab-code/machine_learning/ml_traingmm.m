% 
% Gaussian Mixture Models [1] are well-known generative statistical models that can be used for
% clustering, classification, and density estimation, whereas the provided implementation is
% primarily targeted at classification. The basics assumption of Gaussian mixture models is that the
% data (in each class) is a mixture of (relatively few) approximately gaussian-distributed distinct
% clusters. The optimization methods used for finding these clusters are usually very fragile
% (compared to, e.g., SVMs, where this problem is bypassed) and give reasonable results when the
% data is in fact a collection of distinct clusters, each of which deviates not too much from being
% gaussian, and when there are sufficient samples per cluster, w.r.t. to the total dimensionality of
% the data. These assumptions are usually only fulfilled when the data of one (or more) class(es)
% was derived from multiple distinct situations (e.g. walking, driving, waiting) and when either a
% large number of trials is available, or the dimensionality of the feature space is relatively low,
% i.e. the features come from a an effective adaptive feature-extraction stage.
%
% Several variants are supplied, among others "conventional" approaches using, e.g., expectation
% maximization, which require that the number of clusters is approximately known in advance. These
% are implemented via the GMMBAYES library [2]. Further, there are "advanced" implementations, where
% the number of clusters is not needed in advance, but learned from the data, usually using a
% variant of the Dirichlet prior, which are implemented using the VDPGM [3] library.
%
% A benefit of GMMs is that the produced probability are of the highest quality among all methods
% implemented by the toolbox. For example, data points which are not in any of the previously
% learned classes typically receive equal probabilities under all classes (which cannot be expected
% from logistic regression or relevance vector machines). However, due to their restrictions,
% gaussian mixture models should be viewed as rather specialized classifiers, which should only be
% relied on when the assumptions are fulfilled.
%
% In:
%   Trials       : training data, as in ml_train
%
%   Targets      : target variable, as in ml_train
%
%   Clusters     : expected/maximum number of clusters (required for some variants)
%                  default: 3
%
%   Options  : optional name-value parameters to control the training details:
%              'variant': one of several variants, including
%                        "nonparametric" methods:
%                        'avdp': accelerated variational Dirichlet process, ignores Clusters
%                        'vdp' : variational Dirichlet process iterative, using a per-weight prior, 
%                                   more or less uninformative, but numerically more robust than the 'vb' variant
%                        'bj'  : Blei & Jordan
%                        'cdp' : collapsed Dirichlet prior
%                        'csp' : collapsed stick-breaking
%                        conventional parametric methods:
%                        'vb'  : variational Bayes (exact # clusters)
%                        'em'  : expectation-maximization (exact # cluster)
%                        'fj'  : Figueiredo-Jain (max. # clusters)
%                        'gem' : greedy expectation-maximization (max. # clusters)
%              
%              'scaling': pre-scaling of the data (see hlp_findscaling for options) (default: 'std') 
%
% Out:
%   Model   : a multi-class gaussian mixture model; 
%             classes indicates the class labels which the model predicts
%
% Examples:
%   % learn a simple Gaussian Mixture model classifier (using an advanced method which learns the 
%   % number of clusters from the data)
%   model = ml_traingmm(trials,targets)
%
%   % use the variational Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model classifier
%   model = ml_traingmm(trials,targets,[],'variant','vdp')
%
%   % use the simple Expectation-Maximization method, and assume 3 clusters of data points per class
%   model = ml_traingmm(trials,targets,3,'variant','em')
%
%   % like before, but search over possible values for the number of clusters
%   model = utl_searchmodel({trials,targets},'args',{{'gmm',search(1:5),'variant','em'}})
